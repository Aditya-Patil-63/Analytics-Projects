# Global Trade Analysis using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Global Trade Analysis dashboard** built using Tableau to analyze international trade patterns across countries, years, and product categories. The dashboard enables users to explore **market size, total trade value, top traded categories, and trade balance trends** through dynamic filters and visualizations.

The analysis focuses on three major countries:
- Canada
- Australia
- United States (USA)

The project demonstrates the use of Tableau for **economic analysis, trade performance evaluation, and comparative country-level insights**.
